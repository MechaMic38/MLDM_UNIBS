When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63°C, while in the yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70°C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63°C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70°C. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach 70°C. The following formula expresses the time $t$ it takes (in seconds) for the center of the yolk to reach the temperature $T_y$ (in Celsius degrees):\n","\n","$$t = \\frac{M^{2/3}c\\rho^{1/3}}{K\\pi^2(4\\pi/3)^{2/3}}\\ln\\left[0.76\\frac{T_o - T_w}{T_y - T_w}\\right]$$\n","\n","Here, $M, \\rho, c$ and $K$ are properties of the egg: $M$ is the mass, $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $K$ is thermal conductivity. Relevant values are $M$ = 47 g for a small egg and $M$ = 67 g for a large egg, $\\rho$ = 1.038 g cm$^{-3}$, $c$ = 3.7 J g$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, and $K$ = 5.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ W cm$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, $T_w$ is the temperature (in C degrees) of the boiling water, and $T_o$ is the original temperature (in C degrees) of the egg before being put in the water.\n","\n","Implement the formula in a program, set $T_w$ = 100°C and $T_y$ = 70°C, and compute $t$ for a small and large egg taken from the fridge ($T_o$ = 4°C) and from room temperature ($T_o$ = 20°C)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fj6Q2aNNf3dM","outputId":"9b41428d-3406-4720-ccc7-33176c23a1f5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710627543156,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":290,"user":{"displayName":"michael pluda","userId":"08403293571474270568"}}},"source":["from math import pi, log\n","\n","Tw = 100    # C Temperature of the water\n","Ty = 70     # C Desired temperature of the yolk\n","rho = 1.038 # g cm^{-3}\n","M = 67      # g\n","K = 5.4e-3  # W cm^{-1} K^{-1}\n","c = 3.7     # J g^{-1} K^{-1}\n","\n","for To in [4, 20]:\n","    for M in [47, 67]:\n","        numerator = M**(2/3) * c * rho**(1/3)\n","        denominator = K * pi**2 * (4*pi/3)**(2/3)\n","        logarithm = log(0.76 * (To - Tw) / (Ty - Tw))\n","        t = numerator / denominator * logarithm\n","        print(\"Time required for perfect {} g egg when To = {} C is {:.2f} seconds.\".format(M, To, t))"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Time required for perfect 47 g egg when To = 4 C is 313.09 seconds.\n","Time required for perfect 67 g egg when To = 4 C is 396.58 seconds.\n","Time required for perfect 47 g egg when To = 20 C is 248.86 seconds.\n","Time required for perfect 67 g egg when To = 20 C is 315.22 seconds.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1vMZ9PjIf3dP"},"source":["2.
